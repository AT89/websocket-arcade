# Websocket Arcade

Pick some fun, simple game for two (or more?) players.

Then, turn it into a Websocket-based app that the players can play from different computers!

## Suggestions

- Tic Tac Toe
- Connect 4
- Battleship
- Checkers
- Reversi
- High Card
- Dueling cursors
- Hangman (Think: Pixart)
- Pictionary

## Playing from different computers

If you option-click on the wifi symbol in your menu bar, you should be able to see your current IP address. It'll be something like 172.20.3.229

Someone else can access the server running on your computer by typing into their address bar that IP address followed by the port number, which is probably 3000.

So, for example:

`http://172.20.3.229:3000`

## How do you start?

Begin by assuming the players will play by the rules, and that they'll know when the game is over. Don't worry about, say, preventing players from going out of turn or putting their pieces in the wrong places until later on, when you have something that works. 

## Bonus

Make a game that MORE than two people can play! Create a "waiting room" in which visitors can see who's available to play a game.
